1. Left Sidebar

2. Right Sidebar

### Optional Jetpack Social Media icons
Using Jetpack, social media icons will appear on posts, with the author info.

### Gravatar
Author avatar will appear below post in single view, and in the comment area.

### Featured Images
Posts and pages can have Featured Images. On single post, the Featured Image replaces the header image, with the post pulled up into it slightly.  I think this brings focus to the main content, and utilizes available space well.
